Deadlock Detection and Recovery
This project demonstrates deadlock detection and recovery in a system with processes and resources. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to interactively manage and visualize the resource allocation graph.

Features
Add and Remove Edges: Establish dependencies between processes and resources.
Detect Deadlocks: Identify and notify if a deadlock occurs in the system.
Recover from Deadlocks: Automatically recover by preempting resources from affected processes.
Display Current Graph State: Visualize the current state of the resource allocation graph.
Simulate Deadlock Scenarios: Test the system's deadlock handling capabilities.
Usage
Buttons in the GUI:

Use buttons to add edges between specific processes and resources.
Check for deadlocks and initiate recovery using dedicated buttons.
Display the current graph state to monitor resource allocation.
Simulation:

Simulate deadlock scenarios to observe recovery mechanisms.
