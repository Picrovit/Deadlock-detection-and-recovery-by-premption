# Deadlock-detection-and-recovery-by-premption
The "Deadlock Detection and Recovery by Preemption" project focuses on addressing the issue of deadlocks in computer systems, particularly in multi-threaded and multi-process environments. Deadlocks occur when a set of processes are unable to proceed because each process is waiting for resources held by others, creating a cycle of dependencies.
